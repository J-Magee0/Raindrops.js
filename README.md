# Raindrops.js

A lightweight JavaScript raindrop animation effect — interactive and responsive, with raindrops that bounce off the mouse cursor. Great for fun background effects or visual demos.

### 🧠 How It Works

- A canvas element fills the screen, generating raindrops that fall from the top. Each frame:

- New drops are created

- The animation draws all drops

- Mouse interaction triggers splash effects
